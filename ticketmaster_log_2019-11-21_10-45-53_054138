All events are open to the public and there are no minimum age restrictions. Only specific events will have a minimum age limit which will be communicated in local advertising. Should a young child be unable to sit quietly through a quiet event, ushers will ask the parent or child to step into the concourse until they can be quieted.

The policy supersedes numbers of seats required (i.e. - a ticket is required regardless of whether the child sits in the seat purchased or the parents lap).
